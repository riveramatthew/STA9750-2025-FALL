library(lubridate)
library(stringr)

# Create data directory
if(!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp01"))){
    dir.create(file.path("data", "mp01"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
}

# Set file paths
GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "global_top10_alltime.csv")
COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "country_top10_alltime.csv")

# Download global top 10 data

```

## Task 3: Data Import with Proper NA Handling

``` r
# Read country data with proper NA handling
COUNTRY_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME, 
                          na = c("", "NA", "N/A"), 
                          show_col_types = FALSE)

# Check the structure
glimpse(COUNTRY_TOP_10)
```

## Data Formatting Functions

``` r
# Function to format column titles
format_titles <- function(df){
    colnames(df) <- str_replace_all(colnames(df), "_", " ") |> str_to_title()
    df
}

# Function to create publication-ready tables
create_pub_table <- function(df, n_rows = 20) {
    df |>
        head(n = n_rows) |>
        datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, pageLength = 10)) |>
        formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'), digits = 0)
}
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Task 4: Exploratory Questions

### Question 1: Netflix's Global Reach

``` r
num_countries <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
    distinct(country_name) |>
    nrow()
```

Netflix operates in `r num_countries` different countries based on the viewing history data available.

### Question 2: Most Popular Non-English Film

``` r
top_non_english_film <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    filter(category == "Films (Non-English)") |>
    group_by(show_title) |>
    summarise(total_weeks = sum(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10), .groups = 'drop') |>
    arrange(desc(total_weeks)) |>
    slice(1)

top_non_english_film |>
    format_titles() |>
    datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, dom = 't'))
```

The non-English-language film **`r top_non_english_film$show_title`** has spent the most cumulative weeks in the global top 10, with a total of `r top_non_english_film$total_weeks` weeks.

### Question 3: Longest Film in Netflix Top 10

``` r
longest_film <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    filter(str_detect(category, "Films")) |>
    filter(!is.na(runtime)) |>
    arrange(desc(runtime)) |>
    slice(1) |>
    mutate(runtime_minutes = round(runtime * 60))

longest_film |>
    select(show_title, category, runtime, runtime_minutes, week) |>
    format_titles() |>
    datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, dom = 't'))
```

The longest film to appear in the Netflix global Top 10 is **`r longest_film$show_title`** at `r longest_film$runtime_minutes` minutes (`r round(longest_film$runtime, 2)` hours).

### Question 4: Programs with Most Total Hours by Category

``` r
top_by_category <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    group_by(category, show_title) |>
    summarise(total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') |>
    group_by(category) |>
    slice_max(total_hours, n = 1) |>
    arrange(desc(total_hours))

top_by_category |>
    format_titles() |>
    datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE)) |>
    formatRound('Total Hours', digits = 0)
```

### Question 5: TV Show with Longest Country Run

``` r
longest_country_run <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
    filter(str_detect(category, "TV")) |>
    group_by(country_name, show_title, season_title) |>
    summarise(max_weeks = max(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') |>
    arrange(desc(max_weeks)) |>
    slice(1)

longest_country_run |>
    format_titles() |>
    datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, dom = 't'))
```

The TV show with the longest run in a country's Top 10 is **`r longest_country_run$show_title`** (`r ifelse(is.na(longest_country_run$season_title), "", paste("Season:", longest_country_run$season_title))`) with `r longest_country_run$max_weeks` weeks in `r longest_country_run$country_name`.

### Question 6: Country with Limited History

``` r
country_weeks <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
    group_by(country_name) |>
    summarise(
        total_weeks = n_distinct(week),
        last_week = max(week, na.rm = TRUE),
        .groups = 'drop'
    ) |>
    arrange(total_weeks)

limited_country <- country_weeks |> slice(1)

limited_country |>
    format_titles() |>
    datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, dom = 't'))
```

**`r limited_country$country_name`** has the most limited history with only `r limited_country$total_weeks` weeks of data. Netflix appears to have ceased operations there on `r limited_country$last_week`.

    group_by(show_title, season_title) |>
    summarise(season_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') |>
    arrange(desc(season_hours))

squid_game_details |>
    format_titles() |>
    datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE)) |>
    formatRound('Season Hours', digits = 0)
```

The total viewership for all seasons of **Squid Game** is `r format(squid_game_total, big.mark = ",")` hours.

        reached_number_1 = any(weekly_rank == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
        first_week = min(week, na.rm = TRUE),
        .groups = 'drop'
    ) |>
    filter(reached_number_1 == TRUE, min_rank > 1) |>
    arrange(desc(first_week))

us_films_analysis |>
    head(10) |>
    format_titles() |>
    datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE))

### Netflix's Korean Wave Continues Global Domination with Unprecedented International Success

**PRESS RELEASE**

Netflix announces the continued global expansion of Korean content, building on the phenomenal success of "Squid Game" and establishing Korean storytelling as a dominant force in international entertainment. The streaming platform's investment in Korean creators has yielded remarkable results, with Korean titles consistently breaking viewership records and reaching audiences across multiple continents.

Korean content on Netflix has demonstrated extraordinary staying power in global Top 10 charts, with flagship series maintaining positions for extended periods while attracting viewers from diverse cultural backgrounds. The success extends beyond individual titles, creating a "Korean Wave" effect where audiences actively seek out additional Korean content, driving discovery of both new releases and catalog titles.

The international appeal of Korean programming is evidenced by its performance across `r max(korean_international$countries_reached, na.rm = TRUE)` countries, demonstrating Netflix's ability to transcend language barriers through compelling storytelling and high production values. "Korean creators bring a unique perspective to universal themes," noted a Netflix content executive. "Their work exemplifies our global content strategy—locally rooted stories with universal emotional resonance."

This success has prompted Netflix to expand its Korean content investment significantly, with multiple new series and films in development. The streaming giant continues to partner with top Korean talent, ensuring a robust pipeline of content that serves both domestic Korean audiences and the growing international fanbase hungry for innovative Asian storytelling.

# Conclusion

Netflix's global Top 10 data reveals a platform successfully balancing local content creation with international appeal. From the record-breaking success of "Stranger Things" to the cultural phenomenon of Korean content and the growing importance of regional markets like India, Netflix demonstrates its evolution from a U.S.-centric service to a truly global entertainment platform.

The data shows that successful content transcends traditional boundaries—language, geography, and cultural differences—when supported by quality production and strategic global distribution. As Netflix continues to invest in diverse storytelling from creators worldwide, these trends suggest a future where regional content regularly achieves global success, creating a more interconnected and culturally rich entertainment landscape.
