## Acquire Data

### Task 1: Data Acquisition

```{r}
if(!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp01"))){
    dir.create(file.path("data", "mp01"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
}

# Corrected file paths with proper .tsv extension
GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "global_top10_alltime.tsv")

if(!file.exists(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
    download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-global.tsv", 
                  destfile=GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}

COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "country_top10_alltime.tsv")

if(!file.exists(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
    download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-countries.tsv", 
                  destfile=COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}
```

### Data Import and Preparation

```{r}
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
if (!requireNamespace("plotly", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("plotly")

library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# Import global top 10 data
GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME, show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r}
str(GLOBAL_TOP_10)
```

```{r}
glimpse(GLOBAL_TOP_10)
```

### Task 2: Data Cleaning - Global Dataset

```{r}
# Clean the global dataset - convert "N/A" strings to proper NA values
GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    mutate(season_title = if_else(season_title == "N/A", NA_character_, season_title))

# Display structure after cleaning
glimpse(GLOBAL_TOP_10)
```

```{r}
# Verify the cleaning worked
cat("Season title NA values:", sum(is.na(GLOBAL_TOP_10$season_title)), "out of", nrow(GLOBAL_TOP_10), "rows\n")
```

### Task 3: Data Import - Country Dataset

```{r}
# Read country data with proper NA handling
COUNTRY_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME, 
                           na = c("", "NA", "N/A"),
                           show_col_types = FALSE)

# Display structure after cleaning
glimpse(COUNTRY_TOP_10)
```

## Initial Data Exploration

```{r}
library(DT)

library(stringr)
# Helper function for formatting column names
format_titles <- function(df){
    colnames(df) <- str_replace_all(colnames(df), "_", " ") |> str_to_title()
    df
}
```

```{r}
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
    format_titles() |>
    head(n=20) |>
    datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE)) |>
    formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))

    formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))
```

## Analysis - Critical Business Questions

### Task 4: Exploratory Questions

#### Question 1: How many different countries does Netflix operate in?

```{r}
countries_count <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
    summarise(unique_countries = n_distinct(country_name)) |>
    pull(unique_countries)

cat("Netflix operates in", countries_count, "different countries based on viewing history data.\n")
```

Netflix operates in **`r countries_count`** ddifferent countries, demonstrating its truly global reach.

#### Question 2: Which non-English-language film has spent the most cumulative weeks in the global top 10? How many weeks did it spend?

```{r}
top_non_english <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    filter(category == "Films (Non-English)") |>
    group_by(show_title) |>
    summarise(
        max_weeks = max(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10, na.rm = TRUE),
        .groups = 'drop'
    ) |>
    arrange(desc(max_weeks)) |>
    slice(1)

cat("Top non-English film:", top_non_english$show_title, "\n")
cat("Weeks in top 10:", top_non_english$max_weeks, "\n")
```

The non-English-language film that has spent the most cumulative weeks in the global top 10 is **`r top_non_english$show_title`**, which spent **`r top_non_english$max_weeks`** weeks in the top 10.

#### Question 3: What is the longest film (English or non-English) to have ever appeared in the Netflix global Top 10? How long is it in minutes?

```{r}
longest_film <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    filter(str_detect(category, "Films")) |>
    filter(!is.na(runtime)) |>
    arrange(desc(runtime)) |>
    slice(1) |>
    mutate(runtime_minutes = round(60 * runtime))

cat("Longest film:", longest_film$show_title, "\n")
cat("Runtime:", longest_film$runtime_minutes, "minutes\n")
cat("Category:", longest_film$category, "\n")
```

The longest film to ever appear in the Netflix global Top 10 is **`r longest_film$show_title`** at **`r longest_film$runtime_minutes`** minutes (`r longest_film$category`).

#### Question 4: For each category, what program has the most total hours of global viewership?

```{r}
# Define top_by_category
top_by_category <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
  group_by(category, show_title) |>
  summarise(total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') |>
  group_by(category) |>
  slice_max(total_hours, n = 1)

top_by_category |>
  mutate(
    `Total Hours (Millions)` = round(total_hours / 1e6, 1),
    Category = category,
    `Show Title` = show_title
  ) |>
  select(Category, `Show Title`, `Total Hours (Millions)`) |>
  datatable(caption = "Top Program by Total Viewership Hours in Each Category")
```

#### Question 4 Visualization: Bar Chart

```{r}
library(plotly)
top_shows_hours <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
  group_by(show_title) |>
  summarise(total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') |>
  arrange(desc(total_hours)) |>
  slice(1:15)

plot_ly(
  top_shows_hours,
  x = ~reorder(show_title, total_hours),
  y = ~total_hours / 1e6,
  type = 'bar',
  text = ~paste(round(total_hours/1e6,1), "M hours"),
  hoverinfo = 'text+y',
  marker = list(color = 'rgba(55, 128, 191, 0.7)')
) |> layout(
  title = "Top 15 Shows by Total Global Hours Viewed",
  xaxis = list(title = ""),
  yaxis = list(title = "Hours Viewed (Millions)"),
  margin = list(b = 150),
  autosize = TRUE
)
```

#### Question 5: Which TV show had the longest run in a country’s Top 10? How long was this run and in what country did it occur?

```{r}
longest_run <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
    filter(str_detect(category, "TV")) |>
    group_by(country_name, show_title, season_title) |>
    summarise(
        max_weeks = max(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10, na.rm = TRUE),
        .groups = 'drop'
    ) |>
    arrange(desc(max_weeks)) |>
    slice(1)

cat("Longest TV show run:", longest_run$show_title, "\n")
cat("Season:", ifelse(is.na(longest_run$season_title), "Not specified", longest_run$season_title), "\n")
cat("Duration:", longest_run$max_weeks, "weeks\n")
cat("Country:", longest_run$country_name, "\n")
```

The TV show with the longest run in a country's Top 10 is **`r longest_run$show_title`** which ran for **`r longest_run$max_weeks`** weeks in **`r longest_run$country_name`**.

#### Question 6: Netflix provides over 200 weeks of service history for all but one country in our data set. Which country is this and when did Netflix cease operations in that country?

```{r}
country_weeks <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
    group_by(country_name) |>
    summarise(
        weeks_of_data = n_distinct(week),
        earliest_date = min(week, na.rm = TRUE),
        latest_date = max(week, na.rm = TRUE),
        .groups = 'drop'
    ) |>
    arrange(weeks_of_data)

limited_country <- country_weeks |>
    slice(1)

cat("Country with limited service:", limited_country$country_name, "\n")
cat("Weeks of data:", limited_country$weeks_of_data, "\n")
cat("Service ended:", limited_country$latest_date, "\n")
```

The country with limited service history is **`r limited_country$country_name`** with only **`r limited_country$weeks_of_data`** weeks of data. Netflix ceased operations there on **`r limited_country$latest_date`**.

#### Question 7: What is the total viewership of the TV show Squid Game? Note that there are three seasons total and we are looking for the total number of hours watched across all seasons.

```{r}
# Calculate total Squid Game viewership
squid_game_total <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    filter(str_detect(show_title, "Squid Game")) |>
    group_by(show_title, season_title) |>
    summarise(
        total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),
        .groups = 'drop'
    ) |>
    summarise(
        grand_total_hours = sum(total_hours),
        total_hours_billions = round(sum(total_hours) / 1e9, 2)
    )

# Show breakdown by season
squid_game_breakdown <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    filter(str_detect(show_title, "Squid Game")) |>
    group_by(show_title, season_title) |>
    summarise(
        total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),
        hours_millions = round(total_hours / 1e6, 1),
        .groups = 'drop'
    )

squid_game_breakdown |>
    mutate(
        `Show Title` = show_title,
        `Season` = ifelse(is.na(season_title), "Season 1", season_title),
        `Hours Viewed (Millions)` = hours_millions
    ) |>
    select(`Show Title`, Season, `Hours Viewed (Millions)`) |>
    knitr::kable(caption = "Squid Game Viewership by Season")

cat("Total Squid Game viewership across all seasons:", 
    format(squid_game_total$grand_total_hours, big.mark = ","), "hours\n")
cat("That's approximately", squid_game_total$total_hours_billions, "billion hours!\n")
```

The total viewership of *Squid Game* across all seasons is **`r format(squid_game_total$grand_total_hours, big.mark = ",")`** hours (approximately **`r squid_game_total$total_hours_billions` billion** hours).

#### Question 8: The movie Red Notice has a runtime of 1 hour and 58 minutes. Approximately how many views did it receive in 2021?

```{r}
red_notice_2021 <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    filter(show_title == "Red Notice" & year(week) == 2021) |>
    summarise(
        total_views = sum(weekly_views, na.rm = TRUE),
        total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),
        runtime_hours = 1 + 58/60,  # 1 hour 58 minutes
        .groups = 'drop'
    ) |>
    mutate(
        views_millions = round(total_views / 1e6, 1),
        # Cross-check calculation using hours viewed
        calculated_views_from_hours = round(total_hours / runtime_hours / 1e6, 1)
    )

cat("Red Notice views in 2021:", format(red_notice_2021$total_views, big.mark = ","), "\n")
cat("That's approximately", red_notice_2021$views_millions, "million views\n")
```

*Red Notice* received approximately **`r format(red_notice_2021$total_views, big.mark = ",")`** views in 2021 (about **`r red_notice_2021$views_millions` million** views).

#### Question 9: How many Films reached Number 1 in the US but did not originally debut there? That is, find films that first appeared on the Top 10 chart at, e.g., Number 4 but then became more popular and eventually hit Number 1? What is the most recent film to pull this off?

```{r}
# Find films that hit #1 in US
us_number_ones <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
    filter(country_name == "United States" & str_detect(category, "Films") & weekly_rank == 1) |>
    distinct(show_title)

# Find films that didn't debut at #1 but later reached #1
climbing_films <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
    filter(country_name == "United States" & str_detect(category, "Films")) |>
    filter(show_title %in% us_number_ones$show_title) |>
    group_by(show_title) |>
    arrange(week) |>
    summarise(
        first_rank = first(weekly_rank),
        hit_number_1 = any(weekly_rank == 1),
        latest_week = max(week[weekly_rank == 1], na.rm = TRUE),
        .groups = 'drop'
    ) |>
    filter(first_rank > 1 & hit_number_1) |>
    arrange(desc(latest_week))

climbing_count <- nrow(climbing_films)
most_recent <- climbing_films$show_title[1]
most_recent_date <- climbing_films$latest_week[1]

cat("Number of films that climbed to #1 in US:", climbing_count, "\n")
cat("Most recent film:", most_recent, "\n")
cat("Date:", most_recent_date, "\n")

# Show top climbing films
climbing_films |>
    head(10) |>
    mutate(
        `Show Title` = show_title,
        `First Rank` = first_rank,
        `Latest Week` = latest_week
    ) |>
    select(`Show Title`, `First Rank`, `Latest Week`) |>
    knitr::kable(caption = "Films That Climbed to #1 in US (Most Recent First)")
```

**`r climbing_count`** films reached Number 1 in the US after debuting at a lower position. The most recent film to accomplish this feat is **`r most_recent`** in **`r most_recent_date`**.

#### Question 10: Which TV show/season hit the top 10 in the most countries in its debut week? In how many countries did it chart?

```{r}
#| label: q10-international-debuts

# Find TV shows/seasons and their debut week performance
international_debuts <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
    filter(str_detect(category, "TV")) |>
    group_by(show_title, season_title) |>
    arrange(week) |>
    slice(1) |>  # Get first appearance (debut week)
    ungroup() |>
    group_by(show_title, season_title, week) |>
    summarise(
        countries_charted = n_distinct(country_name),
        .groups = 'drop'
    ) |>
    arrange(desc(countries_charted)) |>
    slice(1)

top_debut_show <- international_debuts$show_title[1]
top_debut_season <- international_debuts$season_title[1]
top_debut_countries <- international_debuts$countries_charted[1]
top_debut_week <- international_debuts$week[1]

cat("TV show with most international debut:", top_debut_show, "\n")
cat("Season:", ifelse(is.na(top_debut_season), "Not specified", top_debut_season), "\n")
cat("Countries charted:", top_debut_countries, "\n")
cat("Debut week:", top_debut_week, "\n")
```

The TV show/season that hit the top 10 in the most countries in its debut week is **`r top_debut_show`** `r ifelse(is.na(top_debut_season), "", paste("(", top_debut_season, ")"))`**, which charted in** `r top_debut_countries`\*\* countries during its debut week of **`r top_debut_week`**.

### **The Culmination of a Cultural Milestone: Netflix Announces Final Season of Stranger Things Set for Late 2025**

Since its debut in 2016, *Stranger Things* has transcended the boundaries of television, emerging as a global cultural touchstone that blends 1980s nostalgia with gripping supernatural storytelling. Netflix has officially announced that the series will draw to a close with its fifth and final season, slated for release in late 2025. 
Over the course of four seasons, *Stranger Things* has redefined the landscape of serialized streaming content. The series has inspired a surge of retro-inspired costumes, viral social media moments, and even propelled Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” to the top of global music charts decades after its original release. At its core, however, the show’s enduring appeal lies in its universal themes of friendship, resilience, and the collective struggle against adversity, resonating deeply with audiences worldwide. 
The data underscores the series’ remarkable impact: viewers have collectively devoted nearly **`r stranger_things_stats$viewership_billions` billion hours** to exploring the eerie town of Hawkins and its parallel dimension, the Upside Down. Stranger Things as maintained consistent popularity in Netflix's Top 10 charts for up to **`r stranger_things_stats$max_weeks_any_season` weeks**, showcasing remarkable audience retention that few series achieve. With a reach spanning **`r stranger_things_countries$countries_reached` countries**, countries, the show has woven itself into the global lexicon, where references to Demogorgons, Dungeons & Dragons, and Eggo waffles evoke a shared narrative experience. 
In the annals of Netflix’s English-language programming, *Stranger Things* stands unparalleled, surpassing the viewership of other major titles such as Wednesday and Bridgerton. Its influence extends beyond metrics, setting a benchmark for the storytelling potential of streaming platforms. 
As the world anticipates one final journey to Hawkins, the Duffer Brothers, alongside the talented ensemble cast, promise a season of unparalleled ambition and emotional depth. What began with the disappearance of a young boy and the arrival of a girl with extraordinary abilities will culminate in an epic finale that promises to captivate and surprise. 
Prepare to venture into the Upside Down one last time. The fifth and final season of *Stranger Things* will premiere exclusively on Netflix in late 2025.
