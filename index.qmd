## Welcome

Hello! My name is Matthew Rivera, and I am a Master's student at Baruch College specializing in Data Science and Analytics. I enjoy transforming complex data sets into actionable insights and building reproducible workflows. This site will host my STA 9750 mini-projects and final project.

You can find mini-projects in the **mini-projects/** folder. Each mini-project will be a separate Quarto document rendered to HTML and included in this site.

Check out my [About Me](about.qmd) page to learn more about my experiences.
